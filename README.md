The Personal Budget Tracker is a Python program that helps users manage their finances by tracking income and expenses. 
It allows users to input income and expenses, categorizing them (e.g., "Food", "Transport").
The program stores this data in a JSON file, ensuring that it persists even after the program is closed.
Users can view a summary of their income and expenses for the current month, including a breakdown by category, and check their remaining balance.
The data is saved to a file for future reference, allowing users to track their financial progress over time.
